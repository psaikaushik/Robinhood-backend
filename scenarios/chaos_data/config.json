  "interviewer_prompt": "Great job implementing the basic feature! Now, we've discovered that our stock data feed sometimes has issues - negative prices, missing values, etc. Can you update your implementation to handle these edge cases gracefully? The alerts should not crash or produce incorrect results when encountering bad data."
